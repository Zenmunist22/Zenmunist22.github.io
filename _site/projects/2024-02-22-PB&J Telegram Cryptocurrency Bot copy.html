  <li>Vercel (Next.js host)</li>
  <li>Python-Telegram-Bot (Library for interacting with Telegram)</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="project-challenges">Project Challenges</h2>
<h5 id="anonymity">Anonymity</h5>
<p>Anonymity is a large reason as to why bitcoin is so powerful. I wanted to protect a users anonymity and make those users feel more secure while they are using my store. A darkweb website prevents an average user from even approaching based on stigmas associated with the darkweb.</p>

<p>This has a couple implications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transactions can be traced when using a bank card</li>
  <li>Users can still be releasing data on their own accord through account metadata</li>
  <li>Users transactions might be intercepted by third-parties</li>
  <li>Users need to feel secure, but might not actually be the most secured</li>
</ul>

<p>Telegram offers API for interacting with their bot chats, encrypted chats, and is a very popular tool for discrete conversations.</p>

<h5 id="telegram">Telegram</h5>
<p>Telegram provides an HTTP API that can be used with a lot of customizability. I wanted to get this project running without having to deep dive into the boilerplate code and was willing to trade off some of the customizability associated.</p>

<p>I chose python-telegram-bot library for its simplicity and representation of the telegram api in similar naming schemes.</p>

<h5 id="bitcoin">Bitcoin</h5>
<p>Bitcoin is known as a “anonymous” currency. Where the coins cannot be traced to the original sender, and if tried will be met with difficulty.</p>

<p>In reality, coins can be traced with enough effort. There are ways to disguise the sender such as Mixers, but ultimately still put the sender at risk of being traced.</p>

<p>Using bitcoin as a user is easy enough. Sign up with a wallet and then deposit money like any normal bank account, finally send money to a specified address.
Users can see a transaction ID associated with the block being verified depending on the wallet’s capabilities. Coinbase shows a TxID but you’d have to do quite some digging. Cashapp has no way to show TxID.</p>

<p>There’s a small fee associated with sending money and can be expensive during high bitcoin traffic hour.</p>
