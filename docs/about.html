<p>I’m 24 years old with a DOB of all nines and I enjoy sports, cooking, and programming.</p>

<p>I started work in my family restaurant when I was around 5 years old. They had this stool for me so I can stand above the counter and talk to customers. I worked in that family restaurant all the way until 11. Ever since then, I worked another of my family’s restaurant in Palm Bay learning the chops until I graduated high school.</p>

<p>In high school, alongside my family restaurant I attended a lot of clubs, dual enrolled at the local college (Eastern Florida State College) and participated in any extracurriculars I could. Especially related to technology.</p>
<ul>

    <ul>
      <li>A national student organization of 300,000+ members that offers a broad program of activities – including exciting opportunities for networking, competition, and leadership development.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>From the end of high school til my junior year in University, I held part-time / full-time paid internship with Lockheed Martin working under their IT &amp; Web Infrastructure Team.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Service Central Workflow Apps (Web Apps)

      <li>Built application forms and automated processes for tasks across lockheed</li>
      <li>Involved javascript automated tasks, automated emails, and creating personalized pipelines for each team requirements</li>
