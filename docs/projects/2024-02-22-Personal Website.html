        <h3 id="current-capabilities">Current Capabilities</h3>

  <li>Routing made easy using Jekyll + YML config</li>
  <li>Hosted on Zenmunist22.github.io</li>

<h3 id="technologiestools-involved">Technologies/Tools Involved</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Jekyll (Static Website Generator)</li>
  <li>Bootstrap (Front-end framework)</li>
  <li>Github Pages (Host)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-challenges">Project Challenges</h2>
<h3 id="static-vs-dynamic">Static VS Dynamic</h3>
<p>While my experience lies primarily in react, I decided to use Jekyll for its simplistic design for static websites and popularity. The website needed to only display static content and doesn’t really require a component architecture to function.</p>
<h3 id="posts-entry">Posts (Entry)</h3>
<p>Makign a post/entry in jekyll is simple. All that’s needed is to define a layout that will import the content. And the content can be written in entirely markdown. 
Kramdown is the jekyll’s default Markdown renderer and supports CSS classes inline (Block Inline Attribute Lists) which allows me to bind my content with bootstrap.</p>
<h3 id="themes">Themes</h3>
<p>Creating a website colors has always been difficult for me. I have always fellback onto MUI to design components and choose colors. I understand a small bit of color theory and UI/UX concepts but I always felt I never can build a theme or know which colors look good together. While using a user-created theme makes the heavy-lifting much easier in this aspect. I decided to give learning more colors a go and will be tweaking the look of this website personally.</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-the-future">Plans for the future</h2>
<h3 id="interactive-content">Interactive Content</h3>
<p>I think clicking content can be more interesting if I had some sort of animation play. Maybe words dissapating or missile explosions?</p>
<h3 id="dashboarding-the-homescreen">Dashboarding the Homescreen</h3>
<p>Always liked looking at stats, I’ll probably display stats about my own adventure when it comes to career and graphs gameifying my life.</p>
