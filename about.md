# About

I'm 24 years old with a DOB of all nines and I enjoy sports, cooking, and programming.

I started work in my family restaurant when I was around 5 years old. They had this stool for me so I can stand above the counter and talk to customers. I worked in that family restaurant all the way until 11. Ever since then, I worked another of my family's restaurant in Palm Bay learning the chops until I graduated high school. 

In high school, alongside my family restaurant I attended a lot of clubs, dual enrolled at the local college (Eastern Florida State College) and participated in any extracurriculars I could. Especially related to technology.
- Technology Student Association TSA (Project Lead)
    - A national student organization of 300,000+ members that offers a broad program of activities â€“ including exciting opportunities for networking, competition, and leadership development.
- Vex Robotics (Programming Lead)
    - Compete in completing themed tasks by building a robot to perform that task as efficiently as possible
- Harris App Design Challenge (Programming Lead)
    - A competition sponsered by Harris (now L3Harris) to promote software projects amongst high schools students
- Lockheed Martin CodeQuest (Programming Lead)
    - A computer programming contest sponsered by Lockheed to pit students in Data Structures & Algorithms problems solved under a timelimit
- Table Tennis Club (President)
    - Sports club organized afterschool in the library


From the end of high school til my junior year in University, I held part-time / full-time paid internship with Lockheed Martin working under their IT & Web Infrastructure Team.

I think I learned my most while following the senior guidance at the company.
